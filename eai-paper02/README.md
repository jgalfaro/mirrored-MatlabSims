# Doppler Effect in the Underwater Acoustic Ultra Low Frequency Band

Numeric simulations of underwater device communications using acoustic waves. Due to the Doppler effect, the communication 
frequency depends on the relative motion between the participants. The simulations assume Ultra Low Frequency (ULF)
range communications, from 0.3 to 3 kHz. The goal is to investigate and relate the Doppler effect to the half-power 
bandwidth, versus distance.
